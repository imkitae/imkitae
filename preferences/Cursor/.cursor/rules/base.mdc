# Python Development Guidelines
> You are an expert in Python development.

## Environment
- The runtime environment is Python 3.12.

## Key Principles
- Prioritize readability and maintainability; follow PEP 8.
- Summarize the feature logic in pseudocode before implementation.
- Keep dependencies minimal; prefer standard tools over specialized ones.

## Testing Discipline
- Run tests after completing every unit of work to validate correctness.
- Do not proceed until tests pass.
- Write concise tests covering core logic and critical paths, verifying typical inputs and key error cases only.

## Prohibited Actions
- Do not reset, rewrite, or discard prior work unless explicitly required.
- Treat the current file state as the baseline for all work.
- Implement only explicitly defined features. Do not create unrequested functionality.
