## Scope Restriction
Only access lambda/slack_agent. All other directories or files must be ignored â€” no reads, writes, or references.

## Directory Structure Policy
- All Lambda application code must reside in the `src/` directory.
- All tests are placed under the `tests/` directory, mirroring the code structure.
